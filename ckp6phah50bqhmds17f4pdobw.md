### Grinding Period ðŸ’ª

As I was finishing the last project I started getting more involved in the developer communities and I met [Lazar](https://nikolovlazar.com/). Still to this day, he's one of my biggest inspirations - his portfolio website inspired and truly astonished me. I peeked around and I love what he does for programmers and he gave me a lot of tips on what technologies to learn and improve on. It motivated me a lot when I met other hardworking developers who are working through their problems just like me. 

Like always, I decided to start a pet project, but this time it was special - I recreated my website  [Andrej's Tunes](https://andrejs-tunes.herokuapp.com/) using Next.js, Tailwind and I decided to move on from Javascript to Typescript. You can find the source code  [here](https://github.com/aacevski/andrejs-tunes). It was quite a productive period and I was very happy with the outcome.

After the positive feedback, I started getting interested in new technologies, some of the frameworks I was experimenting with were: 
- [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
- [Amplification](https://amplication.com/)

Then I decided to apply for my internship at [CodeChem](http://codechem.com/) where there was an Open Day. CodeChem's Open Day is the first event I attended hosted by a programming company but it was genuinely fun. We had a challenge - it was to recreate the game Bejewled. I had a lot of fun and after some time, I secured the long awaited internship.

### Final Words ðŸ™Œ

I hope I managed to motivate some junior developer who're struggling with their code right now. With a lot of love and persistence - you can truly learn any technology, framework or anything - really. On top of that, this was a fun way of me to look on how I've improved these past months and I know that the fire within me won't stop burning anytime soon!
