## Road To An Internship - Starting Off [0/3]

Hey folks!

In December of 2020, I decided to pursue a career as a web developer - in this series of articles I'll be talking about the steps I took. You don't have to follow these exact steps, however I wanted to write about my experience and on top of that I hope to motivate some of you future developers who are currently trying to forge your own path!

I'm far from a full stack web developer, nevertheless I have the mindset of learning new things everyday. Taking that in account, I've accomplished a lot of my goals that I had in mind when I was starting. One of them was securing an internship and working what I love. 

### Starting Off ðŸŒŸ

I have to say that I had prior programming knowledge before I started learning with a more serious approach. Where did I start? CSS. I practiced CSS a LOT. It might sound weird, but if you start working with responsive designs, grid designs, flexbox and the rest, you need to know CSS quite well. 
I recommend everyone who's a beginner to use [Bootstrap's Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) system. 
As I was working through the grid system, I was acquiring knowledge in colors.  [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) is an amazing tool which assisted me in choosing and picking colors. 

My way of learning is making projects - in my opinion that is the best way to learn a skill. I picked up a Udemy course about CSS and created a website called  [Omnifoods](https://aacevski.github.io/Omnifoods/). 

It's not the finest websites, however I acquired plenty of knowledge. Some other pretty useful websites if you're starting are
[Glyphs](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/glyphs/), [0to255](https://www.0to255.com/) and last but not least [Octopus](https://octopus.do/). 

I'm in love with Octopus since it makes sure you plan out your website prior to doing the programming.

That's how I started out, in the next article I'll be talking how I learned about API's, Node.js and much more. Thanks for reading!
